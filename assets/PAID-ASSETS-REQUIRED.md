# 🚨 Required Paid Asset Packs Missing

This project uses **paid commercial asset packs** that are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions.

## What You Need to Purchase

### 1. Sprout Lands - Sprites (Premium Pack)
- **Where to buy**: https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack
- **Used for**: Character sprites, environment tiles, trees, animals, objects

### 2. Sprout Lands - UI Pack (Basic Pack)  
- **Where to buy**: https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-ui-pack
- **Used for**: Dialog boxes, buttons, icons, fonts, UI elements

## How to Install (Drag & Drop Setup)

1. **Purchase both asset packs** from the links above
2. **Extract** the downloaded ZIP files
3. **Drag and drop** the extracted folders into this `assets/` directory:
   ```
   assets/
   ├── Sprout Lands - Sprites - premium pack/    ← Drag this folder here
   ├── Sprout Lands - UI Pack - Basic pack/      ← Drag this folder here
   ├── Bloomy/                                   ✓ Already included
   └── Environment/                              ✓ Already included
   ```
4. **Keep original folder names** - Don't rename anything
5. **Open in Godot** - Engine will auto-import all assets
6. **Build project**: `dotnet build`

## Verification

After installation, you should have:
- `assets/Sprout Lands - Sprites - premium pack/Characters/`
- `assets/Sprout Lands - UI Pack - Basic pack/Sprite sheets/`

If these paths exist, you're ready to run EvoBloom! 🌱
